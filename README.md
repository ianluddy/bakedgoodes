### NextJS site for BakedGoodes bakery ###

I created a website for my wifeâ€™s baking business, BakedGoodes, using Next.js to make a fast, responsive platform that showcases her amazing treats. The site has a clean, modern design with Google Fonts adding a warm, personal touch. I used Next.js to ensure smooth performance across devices and added Google Maps so customers can easily find her business or pickup points.

To simplify orders and inquiries, I built reliable forms with Formik, making it easy for customers to get in touch. I also integrated Sentry for error tracking to keep everything running smoothly. This project was a fun way to combine my skills with supporting her passion.

```
npm i && npm run dev
